                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <br>
                <p>One of the biggest issues I had was getting the music, the video and the timer to stop 
                    when the timer reached 00:00. When the timer reached 0 it kept on decreasing into the 
                    negatives and even when I placed the time variable in an if statement the 
                    clearInterval() function had no effect on it. I solved this by rewriting my if statement.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Through this project I discovered the file size limitations of Github. The original 
                    videos I had for the mood backgrounds were in 4K. These files were too big for netlify's 
                    Large Media and Git's LFS, even with compression to a lower quality. To overcome this I 
                    simplified the backgrounds with shorter 720p videos which are a maximum of 1 minute long.

                <p>This is a website where users can set the mood of the website and generate 
                    inspirational quotes using an API. The user starts off with a simple layout and 
                    background. They can decide the mood, the duration that the music and video would play 
                    and decide if they would like to generate inspirational quotes.
